# GenericCommunicationProtocol
	Intro
This is a generic communication protocol intended to make medical sensor development faster. The protocol is divided into a few simple fields that allow for the contextualization of medical data packets. Look at MedHub's implementation of this protocol as a beginning point for creating your own data types and using the protocol
